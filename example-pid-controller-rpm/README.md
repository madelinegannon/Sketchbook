# example-pid-controller-rpm

This example moves an agent via a tunable pd controller. You can then get RPMs from its velocity and clamp its velocity using a max RPM.

### Controls

- `f` to toggle Fullscreen
- `r` to `Reset` the agent to its start position
- `SPACEBAR` to cycle through `one-time`, `follow moving target`, `follow trajectory` modes
- `Click&Drag` to add to the trajectory
